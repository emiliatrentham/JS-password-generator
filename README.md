## Description
A random password generator built using JavaScript to create strong passwords and provide greater security.
How does it work? The user is prompted to choose a password length ranging between 8 and 128 characters. Next, the user is prompted to choose whether they would like to include lower and uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. Lastly, the user's choices are computed to generate a random password.
